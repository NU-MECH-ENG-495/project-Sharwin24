# Project Overview

Implement a Kalman Filter from scratch for a simulated system (mobile robot, robotic manipulators, etc.) The implementation will use Eigen for matrix math.

Implement the filter on some simulated system with a graphical interface to showcase the performance.

New concepts to learn:
- Kalman Filtering
- Eigen Library
- Graphics and Plotting in C++
